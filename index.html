            <h1>My favourite Food Chicken Lollipop Biriyani</h1>
            <p>The name “chicken lollipop” is a nod to how the chicken wings look after trimming. To achieve the
                lollipop-like appearance, the meat on the chicken wing gets partially cut from the bone and pushed down,
                a technique known as “frenching.” </p>
